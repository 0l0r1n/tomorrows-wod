# Tomorrow's WOD

## Intro

In the last year I have discovered Crossfit and it is my new addiction. I go almost five or six times a week and I love it. I train at Crossfit Amsterdam, a great box with great colleagues and coaches.

Every day after 9:30 pm you can even see tomorrow's workout on the box's blog (not that I would cherry pick). And that bring us to the reason why I started this project. They say great programmers are lazy. I do not consider myself great or lazy, but lazyness was the motivation behind starting this project. Eventually got tired of going online every day at the exact same time to see what's up.
